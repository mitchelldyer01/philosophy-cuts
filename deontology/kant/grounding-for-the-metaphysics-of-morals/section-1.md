### 1.1

#### A *good will* is the only unconditionally *good thing* in the world. A will influences all talents, qualities of temperament, and gifts of fortune. A *good will* is the only correcting power in this world for truly making something *good*, such that success in the absence of a *good will* is inherently off-putting.

> There is no possibility of thinking of anything at all in the world, or even out of it, which can be regarded as good without qualifcation, except a *good will*. Intelligence, wit, judgment, and whatever talents of the mind one might want to name are doubtless in many respects good and desirable, as are such qualities of temperament as courage, resolution, perseverance. But they can also become extremely bad and harmful if the will, which is to make use of these gifts of nature and which in its special constitution is called cahracter, is not good. The same holds with gifts of fortune; power, riches, honor, even health, and that complete well-being and contentment with one's condition which is called happiness make for pride and often hereby even arrogance, unless there is a good will to correct their influence on the mind and herewith also to rectify the whole principle of action and make it universally conformable to its end. The sight of a being who is not graced by any touch of a pure and good will but who yet enjoys an uninterrupted prosperity can never delight a rational and impartial spectator. Thus a good will seems to constitute the indispensable condition of being even worthy of happiness.
