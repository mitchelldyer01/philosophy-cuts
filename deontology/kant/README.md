# Immanuel Kant

## Introduction

Kant did philosophy in the late 18th century. He wrote exceptional essays on
[the Enlightenment][], [aesthetic philosophy][], and [deontology][].

Kant's ideas are special because they help formulate the structure by which
contemporary thinkers do philosophy with logic and reason. They extend further
into art criticism, exploring why recurring motifs and themes in art
elicit common human feelings.
