# Deontology

## Introduction

[Deontology][] concerns the judgment of actions. Generally speaking, it examines
values relating to *why* an actor does a thing, as opposed to the value
resulting from an action.

Often, deontology manifests in popular culture with the following statement:

> the means justify the ends

In other words, the result of an action is not as important as the action in of
itself.
